# Inital project planning

This effort aims to create a new website for the Satakunta Nation
The old website has become cumbersome to maintain, and is built with 10 year old technology. The user experience is also not welcoming.

We plan on using Figma for prototyping and designing user interfaces, Trello for tracking tasks and progress, and Miro for diagrams (site maps etc.). The code is hosted here on GitHub.

There are mainly two people working on this project. Thus it is very important to keep the workflow light and lean, and keep our efforts focused on things that really matter. We will work on this project on our spare time alongside our actual work and studies.

We will begin with two to three week sprints.
